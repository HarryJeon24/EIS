## 📌 Important Notice
This project **must be opened through a local server (localhost)**.  
Do **not** open the HTML files directly from your file system (e.g., by double‑clicking them).  
Opening with `file://` paths will cause certain features (JavaScript modules, AJAX requests, relative paths) to break due to browser security restrictions.
